snmptranslate  -  translate MIB OID names between numeric
                  and textual forms


snmptranslate [OPTIONS] OID [OID]...


Options
=======
...
-m MIBLIST     Specifies  a  colon  separated  list of MIB modules to load for
               this application.   This  overrides  the  environment  variable
               MIBS.

               The  special  keyword ALL is used to specify all modules in all
               directories when searching for MIB  files.   Every  file  whose
               name does not begin with "." will be parsed as if it were a MIB
               file.

-T TRANSOPTS   Provides  control  over the translation of the OID values.  The
               following TRANSOPTS are available:

               -Td   Print full details of the specified OID.

               -Tp   Print a graphical tree, rooted at the specified OID.

               -Ta   Dump the loaded MIB in a trivial form.

               -Tl   Dump a labeled form of all objects.

               -To   Dump a numeric form of all objects.

               -Ts   Dump a symbolic form of all objects.

               -Tt   Dump a tree form of the loaded MIBs (mostly useful for
                     debugging).

               -Tz   Dump  a numeric and labeled form of all objects
                     (compatible with MIB2SCHEMA format).

The snmptranslate command can be used to pull OIDs from a MIBs file.
Very useful when you have no idea what the OIDS in the MIBs file are.
