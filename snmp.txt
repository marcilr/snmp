Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet Standard
protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed
devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change
device behavior. Devices that typically support SNMP include cable
modems, routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, and
more.[1]

SNMP is widely used in network management for network monitoring.
SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed
systems organized in a management information base (MIB) which
describe the system status and configuration. These variables can
then be remotely queried (and, in some circumstances, manipulated)
by managing applications.

Three significant versions of SNMP have been developed and deployed.
SNMPv1 is the original version of the protocol. More recent versions,
SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, feature improvements in performance, flexibility
and security.
