MIB browsers - Gotta view those MIBs


tkmib
=====
tkmib is the MIB browser that comes stock in the Net-SNMP (snmp) package.
Good stuff.


qtmib
=====
qtmib is a MIB browser program, that allows you to connect to any SNMP-enabled
device and browse the MIBs. The graphical user interface is built using QT4
library. The program comes with a large number of MIBs pre-installed, anything
from Cisco's and Juniper's to HP's and Dell's. You can also install your own
MIBs by copying them into ~/.config/qtmib/mibs directory.

For Ubuntu users, the development team makes available a deb package. Download
and install it as:

  $ sudo dpkg -i qmib_X.Y.Z_1_amd64.ubuntu.deb

Start the program from the command line as qtmib or from your desktop
environment menus.  Once started, go into File/Preferences and configure the IP
address and community string.  Retrieve the data from your device, and click
Translate to translate the OIDs in the result window.
