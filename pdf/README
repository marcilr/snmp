  SOL9937: Error Message: No Such Instance currently exists at this OID

  If you make an SNMP request for a non-existent OID, or for an OID that
  has multiple instances without including an appropriate leaf instance
  identifier, the system may respond with an error message that appears
  similar to the following example:

  No Such Instance currently exists at this OID
  ...
  To verify the suspected existence of the intended OID, you can enter the
  snmpwalk command to iterate the entire OID branch by polling the OID
  immediately above the original OID.  You may poll the entire disk percentage
  usage MIB branch by typing the following command:

  snmpwalk -v 2c -c public localhost .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.9
