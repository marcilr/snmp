Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for
monitoring the health and welfare of network equipment (ev2c and SNMP v3
using both IPv4 and IPv6.  The su like UPSs. Net-SNMP is a suite of
applications used to implement SNMP v1, SNMP v2c and SNMP v3 using both IPv4
and IPv6. The suite includes:

o Command-line applications to:
  * retrieve information from an SNMP-capable device, either using single
    requests (snmpget, snmpgetnext), or multiple requests (snmpwalk,
    snmptable, snmpdelta).
  * manipulate configuration information on an SNMP-capable device (snmpset).
  * retrieve a fixed collection of information from an SNMP-capable device
    (snmpdf, snmpnetstat, snmpstatus).
  * convert between numerical and textual forms of MIB OIDs, and display MIB
    content and structure (snmptranslate).
o A graphical MIB browser (tkmib), using Tk/perl.
o A daemon application for receiving SNMP notifications (snmptrapd).
   Selected notifications can be logged (to syslog, the NT Event Log, or a
   plain text file), forwarded to another SNMP management system, or passed
   to an external application.
o An extensible agent for responding to SNMP queries for management
  information (snmpd).  This includes built-in support for a wide the SNMP
  multiplexing (SMUX) and Agent Extensibility (AgentX) pamically loaded
  modules, external scripts and commands, and both the SNMP multiplexing
  (SMUX) and Agent Extensibility (AgentX) protocols.
o A library for developing new SNMP applications, with both C and perl APIs.

Net-SNMP is available for many Unix and Unix-like operating systems and also
for Microsoft Windows.  Note: Functionality can vary depending on the
operating system.
