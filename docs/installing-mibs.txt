Installing MIBs


For licensing reasons, net-snmp package installs only a small number of MIBs
in /usr/share/mibs directory.  A large number of standard MIBs can be
installed using snmp-mibs-downloader package:

# aptitude install snmp-mibs-downloader
# download-mibs
To have the new MIBs recognized by net-snmp, edit /etc/snmp/snmp.conf file as
follows:

$ cat /etc/snmp/snmp.conf
mibs +ALL
$


Adding additional MIBs
======================
To install additional MIBs you would need to create first a local ~/.snmp/mibs
directory:

$ cd ~
$ mkdir -p .snmp/mibs

Drop any additional MIB files you might have in this directory.  To install
CISCO MIBs, download v2.tar.gz file from ftp://ftp.cisco.com (the file is
located in pub/mibs/v2/), and move all the *.my files in the archive in
~/.snmp/mibs directory.
